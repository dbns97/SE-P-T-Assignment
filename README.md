## Compiling and Running
To run the application in eclipse, download the JavaFX plugin e(fx)clipse here: http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html
Import the project, and choose the 'Existing Projects into Workspace' option. You may also need to add the jUnit Library by going to the project Preferences > Build Path > Add Library..., and then adding the jUnit Library. The application will run from the Driver class in src, or as a jUnit Test.
