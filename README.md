## Testing
The tests for the application couldnt be completed in time, because of a lack of jUnit knowledge and further inability to write unit testing for the GUI. The code isn't working or integrated, and can be found in the tests subdirectory.

## Compiling and Running
To run the application in eclipse, download the JavaFX plugin e(fx)clipse here: http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html
Import the project, and choose the 'Existing Projects into Workspace' option. The application will run from the Driver class in src.
